# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Analysis of the Solow Model ** where we have added the extra element XX

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires a few packages that are listed in the beginning of the .ipynb file.

Our project is titled **Wealth Across Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom** and discovers the distribution of netwealth across the three countries Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom..

1. DK.xlsx (*WID.world*) 
1. DEUK.xlsx (*WID.world*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
